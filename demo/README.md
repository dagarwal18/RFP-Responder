# Demo: Run a self-contained workflow

This demo provides a minimal, runnable example of the repository's
high-level workflow (ingest -> extract -> validate -> reason -> persist -> export).

Run:

```bash
python demo/run_demo.py
```

It creates a JSON output file `demo_output_doc-1.json` in the current
working directory.
