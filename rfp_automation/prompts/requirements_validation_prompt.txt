You are a requirements quality analyst. Your job is to validate the
extracted requirements below and identify any quality issues.

EXTRACTED REQUIREMENTS:
{requirements_json}

PERFORM THESE CHECKS:

1. COMPLETENESS — Is each requirement clearly defined with enough detail
   to act on? Flag any that are vague or missing critical information.

2. AMBIGUITY — Flag requirements that use imprecise language (e.g.,
   "fast", "user-friendly", "adequate") without measurable criteria.

3. DUPLICATES — Identify requirements that say the same thing in
   different words. List the IDs of duplicate pairs.

4. CONTRADICTIONS — Identify requirements that conflict with each other.
   For example: one requires cloud hosting while another forbids it.

5. CONFIDENCE SCORE — Provide an overall confidence score (0.0 to 1.0)
   representing how reliable and well-formed the requirement set is.
   - 1.0 = all requirements are clear, complete, and consistent
   - 0.7+ = minor issues only
   - 0.5-0.7 = several vague or duplicate entries
   - Below 0.5 = significant quality problems

Return ONLY valid JSON (no markdown fencing). Use this exact structure:
{{
  "confidence_score": 0.85,
  "issues": [
    {{
      "issue_type": "ambiguity",
      "requirement_ids": ["REQ-003"],
      "description": "Requirement uses 'fast response time' without defining a measurable threshold",
      "severity": "warning"
    }},
    {{
      "issue_type": "duplicate",
      "requirement_ids": ["REQ-005", "REQ-012"],
      "description": "Both requirements describe the same SSO capability",
      "severity": "warning"
    }},
    {{
      "issue_type": "contradiction",
      "requirement_ids": ["REQ-007", "REQ-015"],
      "description": "REQ-007 requires cloud hosting but REQ-015 requires on-premise only",
      "severity": "warning"
    }}
  ],
  "requirement_notes": {{
    "REQ-003": "Vague — needs measurable SLA target",
    "REQ-005": "Duplicate of REQ-012"
  }}
}}
