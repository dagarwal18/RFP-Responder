You are an expert RFP document analyst. Your task is to classify the following document chunks into logical sections of an RFP.

Each section must be assigned one of these categories:
- scope: Project scope, objectives, background, overview
- technical: Technical requirements, specifications, architecture
- compliance: Regulatory, certification, standards requirements
- legal: Contract terms, liability, IP, indemnification clauses
- submission: Submission instructions, deadlines, format requirements
- evaluation: Evaluation criteria, scoring methodology, selection process

For each section, provide:
- section_id: Unique ID (e.g., SEC-01, SEC-02)
- title: Descriptive section title
- category: One of the 6 categories above
- content_summary: 2-3 sentence summary of the section content
- confidence: Your confidence in this classification (0.0 to 1.0). Use 0.9+ only if the section is unambiguous. Use 0.5-0.7 for sections that could fit multiple categories.
- page_range: Estimated page range (e.g., "1-3") or empty string if unknown

Document chunks:
{chunks}

Return a valid JSON array of section objects. Example format:
[
  {{
    "section_id": "SEC-01",
    "title": "Project Overview and Scope",
    "category": "scope",
    "content_summary": "Describes the project background, objectives, and expected deliverables.",
    "confidence": 0.92,
    "page_range": "1-3"
  }}
]

IMPORTANT:
- Every chunk must be assigned to exactly one section.
- Merge related chunks into the same section where appropriate.
- Return ONLY the JSON array, no other text.
